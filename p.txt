We'll see following errors for deno check.

TS2604 [ERROR]: JSX element type 'Link' does not have any construct or call signatures.
    <Link key="en" href={`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/${en}`} passHref>

Let's just resolve this problem by following approach. Please stop and report if it's not possible, instead of doing another approach.

1. Define LinkPatched type for the component, which is valid and compatible.
2. Add import map for next/link for the file for patch.
3. Re-export with patched typed version just by `as any as T`.
